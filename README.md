# Better Standard ML language support for Atom

This package provides the following for SML:

- Syntax highlighting.
- Code snippets.

This package was forked from [language-sml](https://github.com/Jakehp/language-sml)
to fast-track readability improvements for SML programmers using Atom.

### Syntax Highlighting Features

In addition to basic keyword highlighting, we also provide the following readability improvements:

- When a structure member is accessed, the structure's name is highlighted.
