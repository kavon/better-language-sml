# Better Standard ML language support for Atm

This package provides the following for SML:

- Syntax highlighting.
- Highlighting of common top-level values & types.
- Code snippets.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Feel free to open pull requests.

This package was forked from [language-sml](https://github.com/Jakehp/language-sml)
to fast-track readability improvements for SML programmers using Atom.
